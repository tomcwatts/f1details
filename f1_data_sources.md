# OpenF1 API

OpenF1 is an open-source API that provides real-time and historical Formula 1 data. Historical data is freely accessible and requires no authentication. Real-time data access requires a paid account.

## Available Endpoints:

- **Car data**: Data about each car (brake, date, driver_number, drs, meeting_key, n_gear, rpm, session_key, speed, throttle).
- **Drivers**: Information about drivers (broadcast_name, country_code, driver_number, first_name, full_name, headshot_url, last_name, meeting_key, name_acronym, session_key, team_colour, team_name).
- **Intervals**: Real-time interval data between drivers and their gap to the race leader (date, driver_number, gap_to_leader, interval, meeting_key, session_key).
- **Laps**: Detailed information about individual laps (date_start, driver_number, duration_sector_1, duration_sector_2, duration_sector_3, i1_speed, i2_speed, is_pit_out_lap, lap_duration, lap_number, meeting_key, segments_sector_1, segments_sector_2, segments_sector_3, session_key, st_speed).
- **Meetings**: Information about race meetings (circuit_key, circuit_short_name, country_code, country_key, country_name, date_start, gmt_offset, location, meeting_name, meeting_official_name, meeting_url, year).
- **Pit stops**: Information about pit stops (date, driver_number, duration, lap_number, meeting_key, session_key).
- **Positions**: Real-time position data for cars on track (date, driver_number, meeting_key, position, session_key).
- **Race control**: Messages from race control (category, date, flag, lap_number, meeting_key, message, scope, session_key, status).
- **Stints**: Information about tire stints (compound, driver_number, lap_end, lap_start, meeting_key, session_key, stint_number, tyre_age_at_start).
- **Team radio**: Team radio messages (date, driver_number, meeting_key, recording_url, session_key, transcript).
- **Telemetry**: Telemetry data (date, driver_number, meeting_key, session_key, channel, value).
- **Weather**: Weather data (air_temperature, date, humidity, meeting_key, pressure, session_key, track_temperature, wind_direction, wind_speed).

This API seems comprehensive enough to cover the requirements for upcoming races, qualifying, sprints, circuit information, driver details, and various statistics. I will prioritize using this API for data retrieval. I will also look for other APIs to cross-reference data or fill any gaps.



# Sportmonks Formula 1 API

Sportmonks offers a paid Formula 1 API with real-time updated livescores and extensive statistics. It provides comprehensive API documentation, a built-in testing platform, and Postman collection for easy integration. This could be a good alternative if OpenF1 API doesn't meet all the requirements, especially for real-time data that OpenF1 requires a paid account for.
